# EcoTaxa

EcoTaxa is a web application destined to process the large number of images generated by such quantitative imaging instruments. It leverages deep learning and an efficient user interface to allow taxonomists to classify thousands of images per day. In addition, it can store a large quantity of metadata together with the images, with very few constraints on its content. These metadata can be used by the operators to sort through the images and by the machine learning backend to suggest identifications. Finally, EcoTaxa can export the metadata and the identifications together, in a versatile text table or following the DarwinCore Archive standard, for further data exploitation.
